# Intrusion Detection System and Serbian family relationships

## Intrusion Detection System

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software or hardware product that monitors events and the state of a computer system or network. The main goal of such systems is analysis and detection of inappropriate or irregular actions by users who can be located both outside and within the system itself. The IDS learning / training task is reflected in the construction of a predictive model (classifactor) that can distinguish between "bad" connections (intrusion or attack) and "good" normal connections.

## Serbian family relationships

Serbian language is very rich in words when it comes to family relations. This assessment models the ontology of family relationships, describing gender, age, and family relationships.

## Structure

Repository is organized as following:
- `doc` directory contains assignment as well as solution document(s)
	- `OWL` directory contains Serbian family relationships documentation 
	- `IDS` directory contains IDS documentation 
	- `prezentacije` contains presentations about gFacet and Self-Organizing Maps (with example)
- `source` directory contains code 
	- `OWL` directory contains Serbian family relationships source 
	- `IDS` directory contains IDS source
